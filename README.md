# NLP Summarization Application

This application utilizes pre-trained NLP models for text summarization tasks, supporting models like BART, T5, and PEGASUS. It uses PyTorch and Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library to generate concise summaries from user-provided text inputs.

## Features

- **Summarization Models**: Supports BART, T5, and PEGASUS, allowing for flexible summarization options.
- **Custom Model Paths**: Load pre-trained models and tokenizers from specified local paths for customized use.

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.8+
- **Libraries**: `streamlit`, `torch`, `transformers`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install streamlit torch transformers
